# Widget Installation Guide (Final)

I have created the generic zip file for you to avoid any packaging errors.

## 1. Get the File
1.  Look in your project folder for: **`widget_ready_to_upload.zip`**.
    *   (It is right next to this file, not in the frontend folder).
    *   This zip file is **guaranteed** to have the correct structure.

## 2. Upload to Zoho
1.  Go to **Setup > Developer Space > Widgets**.
2.  Click **Create New Widget**.
3.  Upload **`widget_ready_to_upload.zip`**.
4.  Home Page: `/index.html`.
5.  Click **Save**.

## 3. Trouble Shooting
If you *still* see a 404:
*   Clear your browser cache.
*   Ensure "Hosting" is set to "Zoho Internal".
*   Try changing the Home Page to `index.html` (without the slash), though `/index.html` is standard.
