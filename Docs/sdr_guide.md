# Zero-Touch System: SDR Guide

**Purpose:** How to handle Inbound Leads and what to do when automation fails.

## How it Works
1. A Lead comes in via the Website.
2. They select a **Preferred Meeting Time**.
3. The system automatically:
   - Checks which Team is best (Ship, Fulfil, or FST).
   - Picks the next available Rep.
   - **Books the meeting** on Google Calendar.
   - **Converts** the Lead to a Deal.

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Daily Checks
- Monitor your **Open Leads** view.
- If you see a Lead capable of "Zero Touch" (has a Meeting Time) but it is **NOT** converted:
  - Check the **Notes** section.
  - Look for "Booking Failed" or "Error".

### 2. Handling Automated Booking Failures
If you receive a notification or see a failed note:
1. **Call the Lead** immediately. "I saw you tried to book time with us, but our calendar was momentarily blocked. Can we confirm a time now?"
2. **Manually Convert** the Lead once you have confirmed the details.

### 3. Kiosk Button (Optional / Future)
*If a "Book Now" button is added to your layout:*
- Only use this if the Lead is on the phone and wants to book a time *right now*.
- Ensure the `Preferred Meeting Time` field is filled before clicking.
